**Project: Exploring Texas Housing Data with SQL**
- Utilized SQL in Jupyter Notebook to query Texas housing market data, extracting meaningful insights such as identifying high sales periods and analyzing annual trends
- Employed SQL techniques to filter data, calculate mean annual sales by city and year, and identify the highest and lowest sales periods, excluding specific cities
- Conducted complex SQL operations including grouping, ordering, and limiting results to identify trends and patterns in the housing market, such as determining the months with the highest and lowest sales
- Documented and presented the findings using Markdown in Jupyter Notebook, ensuring a clear and comprehensive report with code snippets to illustrate the data analysis process
